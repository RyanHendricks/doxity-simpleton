# Doxity - Simpleton Version

### Documentation Generator for Solidity Contracts
##### Powered by [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)
This project is an attempt to create a working version of the [@digix/doxity project](https://github.com/DigixGlobal/doxity).

Additional assistance in this fix was gleaned from [ProjectWyvern](https://github.com/ProjectWyvern/wyvern-ethereum)

## Getting Started

edit the following files to your desired parameters
- .doxityrc
- package.json

## Load contracts
copy solidity contracts to the contracts folder

## Build the docs

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://www.github.com/ryanhendricks/doxity-simpleton.git
# install doxity dependencies
cd doxity-simpleton/doxity
yarn
# return to root dir
cd ..
# install project dependencies from root folder
yarn
# build the docs
doxity build
```

```
